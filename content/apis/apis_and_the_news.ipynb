    "> *An application programming interface (API) is an interface or communication protocol between different parts of a computer program intended to simplify the implementation and maintenance of software. An API may be for a web-based system, operating system, database system, computer hardware, or software library.* ~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)\n",
    "\n",
    "Put simply, an API provides a way for machines to \"speak\" to each other. Unlike humans, machines do not fare well with ambiguity. APIs allow machines to communicate in a clear, standardized way.\n",

    "\n",
    "The [requests.get](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/quickstart/#make-a-request) function is an API that allows other code (and of course the human writing the code) to easily obtain a file on the Web by supplying a URL."
