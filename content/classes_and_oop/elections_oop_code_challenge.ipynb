    "# Elections OOP Coding challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "So you now have a basic grounding in [Python classes and OOP](hidden_life_of_objects.ipynb). Let's try to burn this new info into your synapses through a coding challenge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below you'll find some toy election data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're keeping it simple for now, but many hundreds -- or thousands? millions? -- of lines of code have been written in the real world to manage the complexities of elections. This code has been written by software vendors to help election officials administer local races, along with lowly newsroom coders (including yours truly) to power election night maps and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenges for any given election include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Organizing candidates by race (e.g. city council, gubernatorial, U.S. senator, U.S. president)\n",
    "- Organizing races by a specific election (e.g. comparing presidential results by state, county, precinct over multiple elections)\n",
    "- Tallying votes by candidate to determine winners, ties/runoffs, and other fun edge cases\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "\n",
    "But enough preamble. Here's our extremely simplifed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row represents the number of votes a presidential candidate received in a particular county.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is structured as a list of [dictionaries](../python_dict_basics.ipynb), with each containing the following data points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Election `date` and the `office` for the race\n",
    "- Candidate `name` and `party`\n",
    "- `State` and `County` where each candidate received a specific numvber of `votes`\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: This data is *totally* fabricated. And yet you feel the nostalgia for simpler times, no?"
