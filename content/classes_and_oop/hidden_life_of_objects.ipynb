    "## Attributes (aka variables)\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, `my_bird.name` resembles a plain-old *Python variable*. It simply stores a bit of data - in this case the default `name` of `Robin`-- associated with this particular instance of the `Bird` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Data stored on a class instance is referred to formally as an [instance attribute](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-and-instance-variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "And we now know that can we access data on an instance using the `.` notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods (aka functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you're shaky on Python functions, check out the [Art of Functions](../art_of_functions.ipynb) before moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the `my_bird.fly()` and `my_bird.eat_worm()` snippets? Did they look and behave suspiciously similar to standard Python functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's because they *are* functions, with an extra ingredient (see section on `self` below) that links them to a particular instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a closer look at the `Bird` class. You'll notice that `fly` and `eat_worm` do in fact look exactly like a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is the code for `fly`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fly(self): # <- Wait, what heck is this \"self\" thing all about?!? Read on...\n",
    "    print(\"I'm flying!! WEEE!!!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Always refer to your \"self\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fly` method looks, feels and acts like a function because it basically is a function. However, when a function lives inside of a class, we call it a **method**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strange and often confusing nuance about methods is the use of the `self` argument. `self` is always required as the first argument on methods, and is assumed to be present by Python's class/OOP mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you forget to include `self` as the first argument to your method, Python will raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You could in theory name `self` something else (e.g. `this`, `that` or `owl`). But the use of `self` is a universal convention. If you use a different name, be prepared for Pythonistas to come after you with pitchforks.\n",
    "\n",
    "`self` is required as the first argument in a method because it gives Python a way to link methods with *a particular instance of the class*, and all the bits of data that are associated with that instance. In this way, when you call a method on an instance, Python knows which bundle of data to operate on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This point may not be obvious in the case of the `fly` method, which is quite simple. Below we'll look at a different method on the `Bird` class that helps clarify why we need the `self` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The widget factory\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be helpful to think of classes as the molds in a widget factory, used to stamp out new widgets on the assembly line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding `self` in the abstract can be challenging so let's dive into a concrete example: the `Bird.change_name` method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the code for that method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def change_name(self, new_name):\n",
    "    # Set the new name on the *instance* using \"self\"\n",
    "    self.name = new_name\n",
    "    print(f'My name is now {self.name}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method allows you to change the name of a specific bird by replacing the default name (`Robin`) that was set when we created the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **IMPORTANT**: You don't ever need to actually supply a value for `self` when calling the method. Python does this auto-magically behind the scenes. When calling the method, you can ignore `self` and assume Python will do the right thing. You only need to supply any other required arguments in the expected order."

    "Below you'll find some toy election data. We're keeping it simple for now, but many hundreds -- or thousands? millions? -- of lines of code have been written in the real world to manage the complexities of elections. This code has been written by software vendors to help election officials administer local races, along with lowly newsroom coders (including yours truly) to power election night maps and analysis.\n",

    "- Organizing candidates by race (e.g. city council, gubernatorial, U.S. senator, U.S. president)\n",
    "- Organizing races by a specific election (e.g. comparing presidential results by state, county, precinct over multiple elections)\n",
    "- Tallying votes by candidate to determine winners, ties/runoffs, and other fun edge cases\n",
