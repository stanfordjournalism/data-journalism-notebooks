    "\n",
    "Above, `my_bird.name` resembles a plain-old *Python variable*. It simply stores a bit of data - in this case the default `name` of `Robin`-- associated with this particular instance of the `Bird` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Data stored on a class instance is referred to formally as an [instance attribute](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-and-instance-variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "And we now know that can we access data on an instance using the `.` notation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods (aka functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "> If you're shaky on Python functions, check out the [Art of Functions](../art_of_functions.ipynb) before moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the `my_bird.fly()` and `my_bird.eat_worm()` snippets? Did they look and behave suspiciously similar to standard Python functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's because they *are* functions, with an extra ingredient (see section on `self` below) that links them to a particular instance of a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a closer look at the `Bird` class. You'll notice that `fly` and `eat_worm` do in fact look exactly like a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is the code for `fly`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def fly(self): # <- Wait, what heck is this \"self\" thing all about?!? Read on...\n",
    "    print(\"I'm flying!! WEEE!!!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Always refer to your \"self\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The `fly` method looks, feels and acts like a function because it basically is a function. However, when a function lives inside of a class, we call it a **method**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The strange and often confusing nuance about methods is the use of the `self` argument. `self` is always required as the first argument on methods, and is assumed to be present by Python's class/OOP mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you forget to include `self` as the first argument to your method, Python will raise an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "> You could in theory name `self` something else (e.g. `this`, `that` or `owl`). But the use of `self` is a universal convention. If you use a different name, be prepared for Pythonistas to come after you with pitchforks.\n",
    "\n",
    "`self` is required as the first argument in a method because it gives Python a way to link methods with *a particular instance of the class*, and all the bits of data that are associated with that instance. In this way, when you call a method on an instance, Python knows which bundle of data to operate on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This point may not be obvious in the case of the `fly` method, which is quite simple. Below we'll look at a different method on the `Bird` class that helps clarify why we need the `self` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The widget factory\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be helpful to think of classes as the molds in a widget factory, used to stamp out new widgets on the assembly line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding `self` in the abstract can be challenging so let's dive into a concrete example: the `Bird.change_name` method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the code for that method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def change_name(self, new_name):\n",
    "    # Set the new name on the *instance* using \"self\"\n",
    "    self.name = new_name\n",
    "    print(f'My name is now {self.name}')\n",
    "    return self.name # this will be text (ie string data type)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method allows you to change the name of a specific bird by replacing the default name (`Robin`) that was set when we created the instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **IMPORTANT**: You don't ever need to actually supply a value for `self` when calling the method. Python does this auto-magically behind the scenes. When calling the method, you can ignore `self` and assume Python will do the right thing. You only need to supply any other required arguments in the expected order."
