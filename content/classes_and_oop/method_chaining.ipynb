    "# Method Chaining\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "dataframe.groupby(\"some_field”).size().rename(\"new_name\").reset_index()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That style of syntax is known as _method chaining_. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you're armed with the knowledge that _methods_ are basically functions that live in classes (and instances of those classes), you can begin to make sense of the phrase \"method chaining\": It's a technique that allows you to consecutively call methods, one after another, _without having to store and operate on the return value of each step in the chain._\n",
    "\n",
    "There's one additional concept that's required to make sense of such code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to Python functions, methods can explicitly `return` a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's construct a new class to prove the point. Here we'll introduce a special method called [\\_\\_init\\_\\_](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#class-objects) that you can use to add data attributes to an instance when you first create it. The syntax is a bit gnarly, but a simple demo should hopefully make its purpose clear."
