    "Now that you're armed with the knowledge that _methods_ are basically functions that live in classes (and instances of those classes), you can begin to make sense of the phrase **method chaining**: It's a technique that allows you to consecutively call methods, one after another, _without having to store and operate on the return value of each step in the chain._\n",
