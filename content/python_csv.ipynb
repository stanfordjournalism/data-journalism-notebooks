    "Files containing comma-separated values, more commonly known as CSVs, are among the most common and easy-to-work with data formats. Government agencies and other data sources often publish data in the CSV format, so it's important to learn how to work with such files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) provides a built-in [csv module][] that makes it much easier to work with these types of files. The CSV module frees coders from having to perform low-level, tedious chores such as handling newline characters and splitting files on commas and other delimiter types. It also helps in more tricky scenarios, such as CSVs in which columns are separated by commas *and* field values also contain commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "[csv module]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html\n",
    "\n",
    "The [csv module][] works in tandem with the built-in `open` function that is typically used when [reading and writing files](python_file_io.ipynb). It can simply be [imported and used](python_libraries.ipynb)in Python scripts, the interactive interpreter or Jupyter notebooks without any extra installation steps.\n",

    "\n",
    "Because `csv.reader` returns rows as lists of values, we must access individual values in each row based on their index position (e.g. `row[0]`). This can be less readable and more brittle from a code perspective. For example, if a government agency changes the structure of a CSV by re-ordering or adding new columns, code that relies on index position will need to be updated.\n",
