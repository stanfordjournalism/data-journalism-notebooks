    "> \"Laziness: The quality that makes you go to great effort to reduce overall energy expenditure. It makes you write labor-saving programs that other people will find useful and document what you wrote so you don't have to answer so many questions about it.\" ~ [Larry Wall](http://threevirtues.com/), creator of Perl\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers make a virtue of laziness. They routinely go out of their way to simplify complex tasks and automate mundane, repetitive work. They avoid [reinventing wheels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinventing_the_wheel).\n",
    "\n",
    "One way programmers accomplish the above is by writing reusable libraries, or packages, of code. Below we'll explore two avenues for making use of libraries.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python itself ships with a large [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) that helps with myriad programming tasks. These include:\n",

    "<h2 id=\"importing-modules\">Importing modules</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Making use of the standard library simply requires you to import a given library or [module](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_modules.asp) (the latter is the technical way to refer to a library in Python).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import and use modules inside a python script, the interactive interpreter on the command line, or in Jupyter notebooks such as this one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's give it a try.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we'll import the [json module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html) to convert a Python dictionary to [JSON](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp), a common data format used in web programming."

Many of these libraries supplement the standard library, while some improve upon libraries already built into the language. The quality and usefulness varies, but in a number of areas, \"best of breed\" libraries have emerged that are frequently used by journalists. They include libraries for:\n",

    "Standard package management tools such as [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) and [pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) can be used to install third-party libraries.
