    "# Python Syntax Crash Course\n",
    "\n",
    "A whirlwind tour of some Python basics, including basic data types, variables, loops and conditional logic. And don't stress -- we'll explain these terms below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we embark on this journey, a word of advice:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Dont try (or expect) to memorize this on the first pass.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is intended to provide ambient awareness of a small but quite useful set of basic Python syntax. We provide references along the way so you can dive deeper into specific topics, and it's not a bad idea to revisit this tutorial once in a while when you're first learning. \n",
    "\n",
    "With a bit of practice and patience, all of the material in this tutorial will become second nature in no time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's kick off our minimalist tour of Python with [data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type), which are among the most basic building blocks of a programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like other languages, Python has a variety of basic [data types](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_datatypes.asp), including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- integers\n",
    "- floating-point [numbers](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_numbers.asp)\n",
    "- [strings](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_strings.asp) (ie text)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we kick things off with a few examples of numbers and text in code \"cells\". These are similar to the cells in a spreadsheet program such as Excel. They allow you to write one (or many) lines of code and then execute, or run, the code cell by cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run each cell using the play (&#9654;) button in the command palette above, or by hitting `Shift + Return`. **Take some time to change the values and tinker.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Lines starting with the pound symbol (`#`) are code comments. This lets us sprinkle in brief bits of explanation  without confusing Python, which simply ignores any lines starting with a `#`."

    "\n",
    "- `number` is just a variable name that *automatically* stores each integer in the list as we \"iterate\" or \"loop\" through the items, in order. This allows us to use the value in the context of the loop.\n",
    "- The above code effectively means, `for <variable> in <list>:`, do stuff. There's nothing special about the name `number` for the variable. We could have just as easily said `for hamster in numbers`. But that would be strange.\n",
    "- Note the colon after `numbers:` and the indentation of the `print` statement. Python uses the colon and [indentation](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_syntax.asp#python_indentation) (4 spaces by convention) to group related code into a \"block\". Above, any code that was indented to the same level as the `print` statement would take place in the context of the loop.\n",

    "\n",
