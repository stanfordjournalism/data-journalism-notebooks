    "# Web Scraping Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are a few exercises to help practice web scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   [Texas Executed Offenders][] - Scrape the list of offender data and save it to a CSV. *Bonus points*: Scrape the `Last Statement` for each offender. This will require extracting links from the `Last Statement` field and scraping those pages as well.\n",
    "-   [Stanford Events](https://events.stanford.edu/) - Scrape the event url and metadata.\n",
    "-   [Palo Alto Agendas and Minutes][] - Generate a CSV of links to all agendas for current year. *Bonus points*:Download the actual agendas and minutes.\n",
    "-   [FDIC failed banks][] - Generate a CSV containing all the bank data on the index page. *Bonus points*: Scrape two pieces of data from the balance sheet pages for each bank. This will require harvesting links from the `Bank Name` field and using those links to scrape the \"detail\" pages for each bank.\n",
